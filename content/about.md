## About 

My name is Mehdi, I am a Software engineer with a great interest in programming
languages like Java, Golang and lately Rust.

I started this blog to write about stuff that I think are interesting or that I've built
and wanted to share with people.

I usually write about different topics such as compilers and distributed systems and library internals.

If you enjoyed the content of this blog, _or not_, feel free to reach out to me
for further discussion about some topic, or if you want to give me feedback.
